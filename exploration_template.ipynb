    "> PISA is a worldwide study developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which examines the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world. The study assesses students’ mathematics, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students’ background, their school and the organisation of education systems. For most countries, the sample is around 5,000 students, but in some countries the number is even higher. In total, the PISA 2012 dataset contains data on 485 490 pupils.\n",

    "- is an age-based survey, assessing 15-year-old students in school in grade 7 or higher. These students are approaching the end of compulsory schooling in most participating countries, and school enrolment at this level is close to universal in almost all OECD countries;\n",
    "- take a literacy perspective, which focuses on the extent to which students can apply the knowledge and skills they have learned and practised at school when confronted with situations and challenges for which that knowledge may be relevant;\n",
    "- allows for the assessment of additional cross-curricular competencies [...]. For 2012 a computer-delivered assessment of mathematics and problem solving was added, along with an assessment of financial literacy;\n",
    "- uses Student Questionnaires to collect information from students on various aspects of their home, family and school background;\n",
    "- uses School Questionnaires to collect information from schools about various aspects of organisation and educational provision in schools\n",
    "- uses Parent Questionnaires administered to the parents of the students participating in PISA (in 11 countries for the 2012 survey)."
